  Timestamp extension flag for In Situ Operations, Administration, and
                    Maintenance (IOAM) Direct Export
                 draft-ahuang-ippm-dex-timestamp-ext-00

Abstract

   This document defines new extension flags for the In Situ Operations,
   Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) Direct Export option type.
   The new flags allow IOAM DEX Option-type to add a timestamp into the
   header.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and

1.  Introduction

   Network operators require delay monitoring accros their network,
   notably when some services undergo long end-to-end delays.  Nodes can
   use IOAM [RFC9197] in order to report this delay to a collector.

   In order to support delay monitoring in passport mode so as to
   leverage aggregation; IOAM Direct Export Option-type (DEX) [RFC9326]
   needs to be extended to accomodate delay monitoring.

   This document defines two new Extension flags for IOAM DEX Option-
   type [RFC9326] to be able to add a timestamp in the header.

2.  Terminology

   IOAM:  In Situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance [RFC9197]

   DEX:  Direct Exporting [RFC9326]

3.  Solution overview

   The IOAM DEX Option-type format is defined in Section 3.2 [RFC9326].
   To be able to mesure the delay between the encapsulation node and the
   current node, we suggest to add a timestamp to the IOAM DEX option-
   type as illustrated in figure Figure 1

   This document proposes two optional fields to be included in the IOAM
   DEX option type format that can be enabled using IOAM DEX Extension-
   Flags (Using currently unassigned flags 2 and 3).

4.  Timestamp formats

   We refer to use the format of TODO REF to encode the Timestamp
   Seconds and Timestamp Fraction fields

5.  Export method

   A way to perform data export of monitored delay using the method
   described in this document is proposed in TODO IPFIX IE draft.

6.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the IOAM DEX Option-type are
   described in [RFC9326].  This documents adds no additional security
   considerations.

7.  IANA Considerations

   IANA would be required to reserve flags 2 and 3 from the IOAM DEX
   Extension Flags registry.
