  Timestamp extension flag for In Situ Operations, Administration, and
                    Maintenance (IOAM) Direct Export
                 draft-ahuang-ippm-dex-timestamp-ext-00

Abstract

   This document defines new extension flags for In Situ Operations,
   Administration, and Maintenance (IOAM) Direct Exporting.  The new
   flags allow IOAM DEX Option-type to add the timestamp into the
   header.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

1.  Introduction

   Network operators want to monitor the delay accros their network to
   understand which nodes add the most delay to the path.  In order to
   report this delay to a collector, the nodes can use In Situ
   Operations, Administration and Maintenance (IOAM) to mesure this
   metric.

   With IOAM [RFC9197], the path delay is measured by inserting the
   timestamp in the header.  In passport mode, no aggregation in the
   node is possible.  IOAM Direct Export Option-type [RFC9326] defines a
   postcard mode allowing to aggregate the telemetry data in the local
   IOAM node.  This aggregated data can afterwards be monitored locally
   and exported to a collector.

   Unlike IOAM Pre-allocated and Incremental Trace Option-type, Direct
   Export only encapsulates the inflight packet at the encapsulation
   node.  Transit and decapsulation node only processes the DEX Option-
   type without modifying it.

Internet-Draft        Timestamp extension IOAM DEX         November 2022


   This document defines two new Extension flags for IOAM DEX Option-
   type [RFC9326] to be able to add a timestamp in the header.

2.  Terminology

   Abbreviations used in this document:

   IOAM:  In Situ Operations, Administration, and Maintenance [RFC9197]

   DEX:  Direct Exporting [RFC9326]

3.  Solution overview

   IOAM DEX Option-type format is defined in Section 3.2 [RFC9326].

4.  Export method

   TODO: add on-path telemetry IPFIX IE draft?

5.  Security Considerations

   The security considerations for the IOAM DEX Option-type are
   described in [RFC9326].  This documents adds no additional security
   considerations.

6.  IANA Considerations

   TODO: this URI already exists, how should this be managed?

   This document requests two new Extension-Flags.

7.  Acknowledgements

   The authors would like to thank xxx for their review and valuable
   comments.
